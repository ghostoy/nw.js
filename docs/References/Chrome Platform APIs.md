!!! tip "NW.js supports all Chrome Platform APIs"
    This document is a snapshot of the [official document](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/api_index) for the APIs for this release.

Chrome provides apps with many special-purpose APIs like `chrome.runtime` and `chrome.alarms`.

## Stable APIs
| Name | Description | Since |
|:----:|:----------- |:-----:|
| [accessibilityFeatures](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/accessibilityFeatures) | Use the `chrome.accessibilityFeatures` API to manage Chrome's accessibility features. This API relies on the [ChromeSetting prototype of the type API](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/types#ChromeSetting) for getting and setting individual accessibility features. In order to get feature states the extension must request `accessibilityFeatures.read` permission. For modifying feature state, the extension needs `accessibilityFeatures.modify` permission. Note that `accessibilityFeatures.modify` does not imply `accessibilityFeatures.read` permission. | 37 |
| [alarms](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/alarms) | Use the `chrome.alarms` API to schedule code to run periodically or at a specified time in the future. | 22 |
| [app.runtime](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app.runtime) | Use the `chrome.app.runtime` API to manage the app lifecycle. The app runtime manages app installation, controls the event page, and can shut down the app at anytime. | 23 |
| [app.window](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app.window) | Use the `chrome.app.window` API to create windows. Windows have an optional frame with title bar and size controls. They are not associated with any Chrome browser windows. See the [Window State Sample](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples/tree/master/samples/window-state) for a demonstration of these options. | 23 |
| [bluetooth](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/bluetooth) | Use the `chrome.bluetooth` API to connect to a Bluetooth device. All functions report failures via `chrome.runtime.lastError`. | 37 |
| [bluetoothLowEnergy](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/bluetoothLowEnergy) | The `chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy` API is used to communicate with Bluetooth Smart (Low Energy) devices using the [Generic Attribute Profile (GATT)](https://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/GATT.aspx). | 37 |
| [bluetoothSocket](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/bluetoothSocket) | Use the `chrome.bluetoothSocket` API to send and receive data to Bluetooth devices using RFCOMM and L2CAP connections. | 37 |
| [browser](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/browser) | Use the `chrome.browser` API to interact with the Chrome browser associated with the current application and Chrome profile. | 42 |
| [commands](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/commands) | Use the commands API to add keyboard shortcuts that trigger actions in your extension, for example, an action to open the browser action or send a command to the extension. | 35 |
| [contextMenus](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/contextMenus) | Use the `chrome.contextMenus` API to add items to Google Chrome's context menu. You can choose what types of objects your context menu additions apply to, such as images, hyperlinks, and pages. | 6 |
| [documentScan](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/documentScan) | Use the `chrome.documentScan` API to discover and retrieve images from attached paper document scanners. | 44 |
| [events](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/events) | The `chrome.events` namespace contains common types used by APIs dispatching events to notify you when something interesting happens. | 21 |
| [extensionTypes](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/extensionTypes) | The `chrome.extensionTypes` API contains type declarations for Chrome extensions. | 39 |
| [fileSystem](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/fileSystem) | Use the `chrome.fileSystem` API to create, read, navigate, and write to the user's local file system. With this API, Chrome Apps can read and write to a user-selected location. For example, a text editor app can use the API to read and write local documents. All failures are notified via `chrome.runtime.lastError`. | 23 |
| [fileSystemProvider](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/fileSystemProvider) | Use the `chrome.fileSystemProvider` API to create file systems, that can be accessible from the file manager on Chrome OS. | 40 |
| [gcm](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/gcm) | Use `chrome.gcm` to enable apps and extensions to send and receive messages through the [Google Cloud Messaging Service](http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/). | 35 |
| [hid](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/hid) | Use the `chrome.hid` API to interact with connected HID devices. This API provides access to HID operations from within the context of an app. Using this API, apps can function as drivers for hardware devices. Errors generated by this API are reported by setting [runtime.lastError](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/runtime#property-lastError) and executing the function's regular callback. The callback's regular parameters will be undefined in this case. | 38 |
| [i18n](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/i18n) | Use the `chrome.i18n` infrastructure to implement internationalization across your whole app or extension. | 5 |

## API conventions

Unless the doc says otherwise, methods in the chrome.* APIs are **asynchronous**: they return immediately, without waiting for the operation to finish. If you need to know the outcome of an operation, then you pass a callback function into the method. For more information, watch this video:
